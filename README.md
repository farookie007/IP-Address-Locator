# IP-Address-Locator

This program gets the IP Address of the computer or
machine on which it is launched and returns a nicely 
formatted message of the machine's information.

The message will display the `Location`, `ISP`,
`Country`, `City`, `IP Address` and other useful
information about the IP Address.
